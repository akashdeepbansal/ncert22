## Broad Categories of Disability

* Blind or low vision
* Deaf or hard of hearing
* Intellectual and developmental disabilities
* Learning disabilities
* Motor disabilities

Disclaimer: Though we will try our best to cover all categories of disabilities. But we have more experience in Blindness and Low Vision.

## What is Accessibility?

* People with disabilities use assistive technologies (ATs) to work on computer independently (e.g. a screen reader that reads out everything on a screen)
* While assistive technologies provide a lot of control, they require certain information to be exposed to them by developers and content creators
* Accessibility refers to compatibility with these assistive technologies and the availability of the crucial information required by ATs to do their job

## Document Accessibility

* Use only unicode fonts
* Simple (not stylish) font style
* Uncluttered material
* Use images only for pictures, not for tables or text
* Use image descriptions
* Provide alternative access to media content
* Make interactive content accessible
* Mark table headers instead of making them bold
* Logical reading order (e.g., Logical heading order)

## Logical Heading Order

* h1: heading
* h2: sub-heading
* h2: sub-heading
* h1: heading
* h3: subsub-heading

Last heading tag is wrong....
