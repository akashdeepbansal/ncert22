    At present STEM education beyond middle school is
inaccessible to visually impaired students in countries like India. A
few exceptions can be traced to enormous efforts of the parents in
working with these students to make STEM text material accessible.
Access to equations, tables, charts and figures are the key bottleneck.
With the increased penetration of screen reading software, effective
audio rendering of equations can significantly help in making many of
the e-texts accessible. Unfortunately, linear syntactic rendering of
equations can create considerable cognitive load even for relatively
simple equations. In this work we plan to address an important aspect
for making mathematical subjects accessible. It is related to contextual
rendering of equations based on the subject of the document as well as
local definitions. We are working on a classifier-cum-locator which can
identify the mathematical definitions in a document. This will help in
adapting audio rendering of equations based on their contextual
semantics.

    Despite significant advances in assistive
technologies, a large section of visually impaired students, especially
in developing countries like India, are not able to pursue STEM subjects
in senior school years and college. Inaccessible STEM content including
textbooks contribute in a major way to this challenge. Clearly when
significant employment opportunities depend upon STEM education, this
has a huge impact on their employability and integration into society.

    Access to equations is a critical requirement for
STEM. Audio rendering and tactile Braille are the two main modalities
used by persons with visual impairment for accessing equations. Audio is
the preferred modality due to ease and cost of production, possibility
of digital dissemination as well as having no need for specially trained
instructors to teach Braille/Tactile Graphics. MathJax [

etc. are some of the common tools used for accessing equations using
audio. All these solutions provide syntactical audio rendering with
optimized use of lexical and prosodic cues. None of these solutions have
the capability of adapting the rendering on the basis of the contextual
semantics. For example, AT can be &ldquo;the transpose of the matrix A&rdquo; or &ldquo;A
to the power T&rdquo; depending on the context whether A is a matrix or a
variable, respectively. Current systems will always read it as &ldquo;A
superscript T&rdquo;, which is a syntactical rendering.

more helpful than simple pattern matching techniques. In our work we aim
to train a classifier for definitions based on a large ground truth set.
In order to construct the latter we have assembled an annotation tool
that presents the concordance analysis of a corpus of pre-processed
documents which can be manually annotated to extract valid mathematical
definitions. In this abstract we present the basic principles of the
analysis and the functioning of the annotation tool.

    The true meaning of mathematical symbols can only
rarely be deduced by their occurrence in a single formula alone. And
although many commonly used mathematical symbols often have widely
understood semantics, their meaning in context of a particular
mathematical text might differ considerably. For example, while in
non-associative algebra structures like rings use addition and
multiplication symbols, their meaning must not be confused with their
counter parts in traditional arithmetic.

    Lack of contextual semantic leads to two types of
ambiguities &mdash;
   </span>
  </p>
  <ol type="1">
   <li>
    <span id="6fa1ccb1">
     Lexical ambiguity &mdash; A symbol can have different
meaning on the basis of the context. e.g., &delta; can be mapped to
KroneckerDelta, DiracDelta, DiscreteDelta, or &delta;.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span id="c6676772">
     Characteristical ambiguity -&ndash; An expression can
have different interpretation based on the characteristics of a symbol,
even after having the same lexical meaning. e.g., w&minus;1 can be an inverse
function or 1/w depending on whether the symbol w is a function or a
variable, respectively. Here, even though the lexical meaning of w and
&minus;1 is same in both the scenarios. Still, the expression w&minus;1 has a
completely different interpretation based on whether w is a function or
a variable. In the former case,w&minus;1 means the inverse function, in the
latter w&minus;1 means &rdquo;1 divided by w

    We can roughly divide the sources from which a
given symbol or expression can get its definition in a document into
three scenarios:
   </span>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span id="23bd453e">
     Scenario 1: The symbol is never defined within
the document, but is well understood in general or in the subject domain
the document belongs (e.g., the equality sign or the normal subgroup
sign in Group theory). Note here there is some implicit assumption about
the audio rendering system already having default meaning of symbols for
every domain.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span id="1ffdeffd">
     Scenario 2: The symbol is defined once within
the document and is expected to carry that meaning throughout the
document.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span id="a33ac50b">
     Scenario 3: The same symbol is defined multiple
times within the document and is expected to carry that meaning only
within the scope of those definitions. In this case, it is also
necessary to determine the scope of each definition and thus tailor the
rendering accordingly.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   <span id="c691c34b">
    Scenario (1) requires the identification of
subjects domains having different semantics and creation of default
symbol mappings for each domain. To some extent, this exists for certain
topics, e.g., Wikipage [

    ] provides a detailed
list of definitions of mathematical symbols in a small number of
different subjects. While reading a document dealing with probabilities,
reading P (A) as &ldquo;Probability of event A&rdquo; is critical for understanding
the equation instead of &ldquo;P OpenParen A CloseParen&rdquo;. One could naively
enforce an interpretation of P as probability or allow for explicit
selection of the domain. But even if the subject domain is explicitly
known to be probability theory, a default interpretation for P as
probability might not necessarily be correct, as P could for example
also denote a polynomial or a partition. Therefore, a dynamic approach
should be more robust.

  <p>
   <span id="0c6835a9">
    In our work, we are therefore focusing on the
semantic information, which can be learned from the document itself; no
prior domain knowledge is required. Hence, this work covers the
scenarios (2) and (3) in the above list.

     Identifying the scope of these definitions: To
distinguish between the above mentioned scenarios (2) and (3), it needs
to be inferred whether the given definition&rsquo;s scope is local or global.
We plan to achieve it by checking whether a particular expression/symbol
has multiple different definitions in the given document and associating
the occurrence of that particular expression/symbol to an immediately
preceding definition. By default, the expression/symbol would be mapped
to the lexical meaning. After working on the scenario (1), it can be
mapped to the default meaning associated with the subject.

    3 Concordance Analysis
   </span>
  </h1>

   <span id="7067742b">
    Our machine learning approach is based on a
concordance analysis, that is on a enumeration of all expressions in
question together with the context in which they occur. In our case, we
are working with mathematical expressions and as context we take up to
five words or expressions before and after the principal expression.

    contains a number of examples of concordances, where the
principal mathematical expression is marked in red. Note, that single
mathematical expressions are counted as a single element of the
concordance, regardless of the number of symbols they contain. Moreover,
while the principal is usually in the center, this can be broken up by
paragraph making concordance pre-or postfixes shorter than five
expressions/words.

    4 Annotation Tool and Ground Truth
   </span>
  </h1>
  <p>
   <span id="784e53b2">
    To generate the ground truth we need to annotate
the concordances manually by several independent annotators. Although
there are a number of tools for concordance analysis and corpus
annotations available, none can adequately deal with documents
containing considerable amount of mathematics. We have consequently
developed an annotation tool with the objective to provide an efficient
way for annotating the concordances having and not having a valid
mathematical definition.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span id="79bab05a">
    For this, we took around 100 XML documents from
various domains of STEM. In these documents, the tool first identifies
the mathematical entities (maybe a symbol or expression). As in general
on the web, we found documents which are not appropriately tagged.
Hence, the tool searches for various tags such as MathML, bold, and
italic, and also look for the LATEX expressions. The tool searches for
bold and italic because many of the times authors tagged the
mathematical entities by bold/italic to give the same visual appearance.
The average number of entities identified in the documents are 1052.644,
having max of 3046 and min of 252 and standard deviation of 586.2051.

concordance is vectorized using term frequency and inverse document
frequency, abbreviated as tf-dif. We have used uni-grams as well as
bi-grams and taken logarithm of their term-frequency. The SVM, from
library sickit-learn, is trained with early-stopping and uses 20% of the
training data as validation set. We have used the same tf-idf based
feature vector for SVM as well. As evident from the table

    , SVM provides better
f1-score and makes for a better choice for a baseline classifier. In
Future experiment on classifier, we will try to bring in semantics of
the context window using deep-learning based models to learn embeddings
for the concordances that might help improve the accuracy and f1-score.

    7 Conclusion and Future Work
   </span>
  </h1>
  <p>
   <span id="77cb3bb2">
    The developed annotation tool is found to be very
useful in quickly annotating the files for generating ground-truth. Even
with limited annotations, using a classifier we are able to achieve an
accuracy of 85% and f1-score of 0.70. SVM with early-stopping is found
to be a better choice for baseline classifier.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span id="ce1ef9f5">
    Further, We are exploring the possibility of more
meaningful replacement of mathematical symbols/expressions for
tokenization. We also want to explore how we can use these definitions
for semantic disambiguation of the mathematical symbols. We are also
analyzing whether the current choice of five previous and next words is
&rdquo;appropriate and effective&rdquo; or it needs to be changed. Finally, we want
to identify each mathematical definition&rsquo;s scope to determine whether
this is a local or global definition.
